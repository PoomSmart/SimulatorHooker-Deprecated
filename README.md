SimulatorHooker
==========

A useful toolset for developers (at least for me) for testing their apps on iOS simulator.

Injector library would take care of loading code into UIKit applications.

Tested on Xcode 8 beta, iOS 10 beta, with latest branch of theos.

Update: Deprecated. Moved to simject.
